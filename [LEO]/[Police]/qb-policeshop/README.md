Original script is here: https://github.com/NevoSwissa/CL-PoliceGarage <-- all credit goes to NevoSwissa

#Description
For this script to work you must properly edit the config to go with your police job(s)

What I added was the ability to add job grades to the shop, for further customizability. Added in a helicopter shop aswell with the same job grades.

Also removed the RBG for the original config, and removed the impound feature from the buy menu, the transparancy stuff and other config

# Read me
Any car you are adding into the config must also be in your shared vehicle.lua
